# Ahoy!
Here's some information about the code in this directory. This code is branched from https://github.com/sgaobnl/CE_LD.git at the nEXO branch in April 2024; I took the necessary code used for communicating with the SBND FEMB and ProtoDUNE WIB and based WIB_script1.py on top_on.py.


# Set the path to save data
Edit setdatadir.py to assign the directory
```
savedir = "/home/nfs/sgao/SBND_Installation/data/1129/"
```
## Use WIB_script1 for operation
```
python WIB_script1.py
```
